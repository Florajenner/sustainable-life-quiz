# About The Sustainable Life Quiz

The Sustainable Life Quiz is a game fully intended to highlight users' sustainable living practices and depending on their score, encourage them to live a more sustainable life or congratulate them on living sustainably. The quiz aims to encourage individuals to think about changes they could make in their daily lives that will have a positive impact on the environment.

## Design

The quiz features a functional design. The straightforward design and generous use of white space improve the site's readability and user experience. The choice of colors and visuals is in harmony with the brand's environmentally conscious values, creating a sense of eco-friendliness.

### Color Scheme

The site is designed to work alongside the Sustainable Life website ([Sustainable Life Website](https://florajenner.github.io/sustainable-life) and as such uses the same color palette. The green color palette reflects the sustainable theme of the quiz.

### Typography

The font 'Quattrocento Sans' used for all headings and subheadings is sans-serif with clean lines, generating a minimalist and modern look for the website. The font choice for paragraphs is 'Quattrocento'. This easy-to-read font ensures readability and clarity.

## Features

- Fully Responsive Design - The quiz is designed to be responsive to a variety of devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.
- Quiz Data - The quiz has a range of questions on sustainability, each with five options. Each option has a points value depending on how sustainable it is between 1 and 5. This means that the user gets an overall score reflecting their sustainability.
- Progress Bar - The quiz includes a progress bar that automatically updates as the user goes through the quiz. This feature is intended to encourage users to finish the quiz as it shows them how much they have completed.

- Result Display - Once the user has finished answering the questions, a results page is displayed showing their score along with a message depending on the percentage they scored. This makes the user feel like the quiz is more personal and encourages them to become more sustainable and try the quiz again in the future.

## Content

All content written by Flora Jenner (Developer).
The example Code Institute Read Me file, which this Read Me file is based on.

## Validator Testing

Both the HTML5 and CSS3 code was put through WSC validators.
HTML5 passed with a warning that I decided was best not to change as it would have meant incorporating an unnecessary div element.
CSS3 passed without errors.
Lighthouse showed good scores.

## Future projects

Looking ahead, the vision for the quiz includes incorporating user-friendly sharing features, allowing our users to effortlessly share the quiz with friends and family. I would also like to include a high score feature and a way for users to compare their score against others.
